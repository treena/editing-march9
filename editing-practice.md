# Taming the SUV
The popularity of sport utiltiy vehicles (SUVs) and other light trucks such as pick-ups and minivans has taken a big bite out of efforts to improve air quality, and reduce global warming. But a new Union of Concerned Scientist report, Greener SUVs, shows that these high-way monstors can be tamed. Using off the shelf technology, UCS enginners have created a blue-print for an SUV that meets high standards for fuel efficiency and emission control – with no loss ofthe teeth that make SUV’s so popular.

Envirnomental regulations that govern fuel economy and tail pipe pollution from passenger vehicles, continue to ignore light trucks. The average truck on the road today emit 47 % more smog forming exhaust and 43 percent more of the heat-trapping gases that cause global warming than the average car. The impact of this gap
has been compounded by a dramatic shift in America’s passenger vehicle market. Over the past 2 decades, sales of light trucks have tripled. They once accounted for less than a fifth of new vehicle sales, they now approach 1⁄2. The combination—loopholes plus booming sales of light trucks have created enough global-warming gases and smog-forming pollution to equal the output of an additional forty million cars.
