# Taming the SUV
The popularity of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and other light trucks, such as pick ups and minivans, has taken a big bite out of efforts to improve air quality and reduce global warming. But a new Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) report, Greener SUVs, shows that these highway monsters can be tamed. Using off-the-shelf technology, UCS engineers have created a blueprint for an SUV that meets high standards for fuel efficiency and emission control--with no loss of the teeth that make SUVs so popular.

Environmental regulations that govern fuel economy and tailpipe pollution from passenger vehicles continue to ignore light trucks. The average truck on the road today emits 47 percent more smog-forming exhaust and 43 percent more of the heat-trapping gases that cause global warming than the average car. The impact of this gap has been compounded by a dramatic shift in Americaâ€™s passenger vehicle market. Over the past two decades, sales of light trucks have tripled. While they once accounted for less than one-fifth of new vehicle sales, they now approach one-half. The combination of loopholes plus booming sales of light trucks have created enough global-warming gases and smog-forming pollution to equal the output of an additional forty million cars.
